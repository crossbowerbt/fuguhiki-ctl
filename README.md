FuguHiki Control and Build Scripts
==================================

**FuguHiki** is a live and minimalistic OpenBSD distribution based on
the excellent [FuguIta](https://fuguita.org/) of Yoshihiro Kawamata.
It adds a few configurations and packages by default and a way to customize
the live system without using persistent partitions, but modifying directly
the system image, even when the os is running.

This is achieved by a single script, i.e. *fuguhiki-ctl* the main content
of this repo.

FuguHiki is first of all my personal take at how a live system should be
designed.

The name is a pun on the original name of the distro: fuguhiki is a special
kind of japanese knife with a very narrow blade profile and ground much
thinner to enable it to cut extremely thin slices of Fugu (Blowfish).
